#### Ninja AI Agent

The web interface features a conversational AI agent powered by Google's Gemini model. You can type commands in natural language, and it will interpret your intent, perform actions, and answer questions.

**Capabilities:**
- **Text-Based Chat**: Type commands to the robot in real-time.
- **Voice Input**: Speak commands to the robot using your microphone.
- **Web Search**: The agent can search the internet to answer questions.

**2. Interacting with the Agent**

Once the key is set, the chat interface will appear.

-   **Text Input**: Type a command in the chat box and press Enter or click the "Send" button.

-   **Voice Input**: Click the microphone button (🎤) to start recording. The button will turn red. Speak your command. The recording will stop automatically after 3 seconds of silence or manually if you click the button again. The button will turn green, and your voice command will be sent to the robot. Note: Your browser will ask for microphone permission the first time.

-   **System Log**: This box shows the AI's "thought process," including when it performs a web search or what physical actions it decides to take.

### 3. Accessing the Robot Remotely (Optional)

The web server automatically uses a tool called `ngrok` to create a secure, public URL for your robot's control panel. This is useful if you want to control your robot from a device that is not on the same local network.

**Step 1: First-Time Setup (One-Time Only)**

To enable this feature, you need to link `ngrok` to a free account.

1.  **Sign Up**: Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and create a free account.
2.  **Add Authtoken**: Copy the authtoken from your ngrok dashboard and run this command in the `NinjaRobotV3` directory (replace `<YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>` with your actual token):
    ```bash
    ./ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
    ```

**Step 2: Start the Server and Connect**

Now, just start the server as usual.

1.  **Run the NinjaRobot Web Server**:
    ```bash
    uv run web-server
    ```
2.  **Access the Web Interface**: The robot will now perform its startup sequence:
    *   First, a **QR code** will appear on the robot's LCD screen. For the easiest connection, scan this code with your smartphone or tablet to instantly open the control interface. The QR code will be displayed until you send your first command to the robot. After the first interaction, the screen will switch to an idle face, indicating that the robot is fully booted and ready for commands.
    *   Alternatively, you can always connect by typing the **Public URL** from the terminal into your browser. Look for a line in the output like this:
        ```
        - Secure Public URL (HTTPS): https://<random-string>.ngrok-free.app
        ```
