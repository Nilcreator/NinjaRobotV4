This project is a reconstruction of the NinjaRobotV3, aiming to improve its structure, maintainability, and reusability. 

## Current Status

The `pi0vl53l0x` library for the VL53L0X distance sensor has been created and is ready for testing. The code has been refactored to align with the new project structure.

## Previous Status

- The `pi0buzzer` library was created and is ready for testing. This library provides control over a passive buzzer connected to a Raspberry Pi. Step-by-step testing instructions have been generated and are available.
